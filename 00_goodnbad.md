Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went poorly.
An instance when I was teaching something computer science related and it went poorly was when I had expert bias during my first year of teaching CS in our first programming lab, which involved iteration.  It can be hard - especially at first -  for someone who knows something to imagine what it is like not to know it and break down the complex skill into discrete units that can be taught in a supportive way.  Even if an excellent curriculum has already been prepared with a script and assignments, so much can go wrong.  As my cooperating teacher taught me some time ago, a great sign of an experienced teacher is someone who can anticipate challenges before they arise and be prepared with ways of addressing those when they arise.  I no longer plan with my top student in mind, but I try to consider all of my students much more.  Eliminating expert bias is key to being an effective CS teacher.
Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related  and it went really well.
There is something magical and thrilling about teaching computer science in 2022.  We are at a strange time when the discipline is being recognized as extremely important and moving toward becoming a core content area while students simultaneously often have little to no background in the discipline.  This means that we get to play the magician as we introduce young people to the magic of CS and programming, which is thrilling.  One great example of this is with Daria (not her real name), one of a number of students who are now majoring in CS after taking my class.  Daria had originally planned on pursuing Environmental Science in college, but she was so taken with the coding that we did together that she decided to shift gears into CS.  She spoke to an auditorium full of students, parents, teachers, and administrators about how much our class changed her life, and she returned as a guest speaker a few times after that.  I think that this went so well because I am genuinely extremely passionate about teaching computer science, and as I learn new ways to provided needed supports and encouragement, I hope to grow even more successful.
