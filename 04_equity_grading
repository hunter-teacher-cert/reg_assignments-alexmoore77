Assignment 4

* In a markdown document, provide your reaction to the suggestions made in the episode.
    - Do you agree with the general sentiment or not?
    - Do yo have specific points of agreemnt/disagreement?
  * For those of you currently teaching: Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so?
  
    I read the transcript of Season 4 Episode 2:  Grading for Equity, and I was not impressed.  The main reason that I was not moved is that I have heard all of these ideas before.  I led a book club at my school on the book *Grading Smarter, Not Harder:  Assessment Strategies that Motivate Kids and Help Them Learn.*  This book presented arguments that are almost identical to those relayed in the show.
    
    The second reason I am not impressed is that I feel like the theory warrants some consideration, but my belief is that in practice mastery based grading actually leads to lower standards and less learning.  This is because - as the speaker points out - we have to consider the larger systems at play here.  Once mathematically computer scores are no longer used - however flawed they may be as assessment measurements - there is just way too much room for political games and inequity, ironically enough.  If an administration wants graduation rates to go up, their teachers may find themselves using mastery based grading and being asked to give students an eleventh-hour project that will allow them to pass the course in one shot.
    
    I do not disagree with all of the points made here.  I agree with the following:
"So what I talk about is having the grade only reflect the content mastery—the level of content understanding."  If this were true, I would embrace mastery based grading. 
"And help students understand that there is a relationship between those, that the homework is not for the teacher, it’s actually for the students. And I will help build in them an intrinsic understanding of the relationship between that practice and the performance."  This can be done with or without lateness penalty, however.
