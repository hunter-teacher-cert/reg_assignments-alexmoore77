Final Project Changes Due to Feedback

As a result of my groupâ€™s feedback, I made updates to my lesson plan: 
I made the lesson more interactive with a Do Now that hooked people in. 
There are clear connections throughout the lesson to prior knowledge. 
The final activity is now differentiated by skill level. 
It is a more hands-on lesson where the students have the opportunity to engage directly with the material.
