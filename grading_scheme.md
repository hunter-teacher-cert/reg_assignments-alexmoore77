I would grade this as five distinct assignments with points.  There are definitely overlapping skills being assessed, but there are also distinct skills for each problem in the series.  

Rubric:  Python CSV NYC Historical Population Project

1 _Approaches Standards (70)_:	Python code opens nyc_pop.csv OR reads its contents into a string called text.	
1 _Meets Standards (85)_:	Python code opens nyc_pop.csv AND reads its contents into a string called text.	
1 _Exceeds Standards (100)_:	Python code opens nyc_pop.csv AND reads its contents into a string called text.  The function returns a list with headers only.
2 _Approaches Standards (70)_:	The function takes the string and returns a list.	
2 _Meets Standards (85)_:  The function takes the string and returns the appropriate list of lists.	
2 _Exceeds Standards (100)_:	The function takes the string and returns the appropriate list of lists.  Each sublist represents one line from the file, and each element represents one value.
3 _Approaches Standards (70)_:	The function takes a list of lists and creates a dictionary.	
3 _Meets Standards (85)_:  The function takes a list of lists and creates a dictionary with keys being years.	
3 _Exceeds Standards (100)_:	The function takes a list of lists and creates a dictionary with keys being years and values being lists of population.
4 _Approaches Standards (70)_:	The function modifies each value in the dictionary to be dictionaries.	
4 _Meets Standards (85)_:  The function modifies each value in the dictionary to be dictionaries where the keys are headers or the values are the corresponding numbers from the existing data.	
4 _Exceeds Standards (100)_:	The function modifies each value in the dictionary to be dictionaries where the keys are headers and the values are the corresponding numbers from the existing data.
