  **Instructions**
  * Describe 3 diffferent strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class.
  * Things to consider
    - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
    - Are students being grouped? If so, how?
    - What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
    - Anything else you deem important

-I am primarily differentiating for ability.  I ask myself when I plan, "How will this lesson be received by my top performing student?  
How will it be received by a struggling student?"  The answers will likely be different, but I want there to be something for everyone where it works on multiple levels, 
like a Shakesparean play or a Simpsons episode.
-Students are grouped.  Student grouping has vexed me to no end as I have not heard compelling arguments for grouping one way or another.  I used to group heterogenously by grade 
average.  That way the strong students can help the weak ones, right?
Wrong.  The strong students feel bored and frustrated working with weaker kids, and the weaker ones are often unable to get the help they need from someone far above their 
level.  Instead, I have begun grouping homogeneously.  This allows me to target the groups that tend to need help more easily, and the kids enjoy working with peers who understnad 
material in a similar way to how they do.
- The goal of differentiation is to advance student learning for every single young person who enters the classroom.  
- I appreciated that you mentioned in class the published argument against the Multiple Intelligences Theory.  The lack of meaningful dissent and debate in our universities 
and secondary schools about pedagogy is disheartening.  Groupthink helps no one.  There is a reason why papers and studies are peer reviewed.  Whenever a new education 
intiative comes along, the appropriate response is, "By what metric will we measure the effectiveness of this strategy, and will it be discontinued if it does not work?"  
I express this because I care about students and M.A. in education program, and I think we all owe it to ourselves to be open about our perspectives.  Students will benefit.
